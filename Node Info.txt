Node Info
#########
when "node" is hit from CLI a REPL[Read, Eval, Print, Loop] session will be opened (.exit is used to exit out of node REPL session)

ctrl + l -> this clears the node REPL session.

use ".editor" to open REPL session to write or edit multiline node functions/lines
use ctrl + d to save the edited lines available to the session

".help" command lists all the sub commands which are useful while working around node.
"." with TAB gives you the library/API help

TAB TAB -> gives global library/API details.

"_" will always have last evaluated command value. this can be used to get values. similar to $? in bash
